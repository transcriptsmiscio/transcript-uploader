<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Searching for logs and code**

I’m planning to confirm by examining the relevant files to find specific console logs and code. The developer instructions suggest using codebase_search for this exploration. A good starting question could be: "Where are Google Drive uploads handled and logs printed?" Since codebase_search is semantic, I might want to grep for specific strings like "Drive parent in use" or "Files detected for upload." I’ll run multiple grep queries in parallel for different log phrases, including checking for 'console.log(' occurrences. Let’s gather the information!</details></think>

I'll look up where those log messages originate in your codebase so I can explain what this output represents.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Explaining server logs**

The user has asked, "What is this?" in relation to terminal_selection logs from their app, showing server logs. I’ve identified the origin with the grep tool and confirmed the need for a status update prior to tool calls. 

Now, I’ll provide a concise explanation of the output: it represents server logs from the API route `/api/submit`, detailing the creation of a Google Drive folder and the upload of `nationalID` and `transcript1` files, along with the logging of payload keys, notes, folder URL, and a response status of 200.  

I'll also outline the mapping of each log line and include relevant code references from the route.ts file to clarify.
**Considering updates and code references**

I need to ensure the conversation starts with a status update before any new batch of tool calls. If I'm using multiple tools, I’ll add a micro-update. But do I really need to include more? It might help to add code references for clarity, though I want to keep things concise. 

I can include a short mapping with bullet points mentioning only line numbers and the file, stating it’s from the route.ts lines. They likely want clarity on what the logs show, so I’ll balance brevity with helpfulness.
**Summarizing server-side logs**

I need to provide a straightforward explanation of the server-side logs from the `/api/submit` API route in Next.js. Here’s what these logs show: the chosen Google Drive parent ID, resolved parent folder metadata, detected file keys for upload, the name of the created student folder, each uploaded file's Drive IDs, payload keys sent for submission, notes (undefined), the resolved folder URL, and a 200 status indicating success. This confirms that the upload and submission are complete. 

I can also suggest ways to manage logging, like toggling verbose logging via an environment variable or removing `console.log` statements. However, I want to keep it minimal. Since we did a status update at the beginning, I’ll wrap up with a brief summary: nothing was edited, but I'm summarizing the logs for clarity.
**Adhering to markdown specifications**

I need to follow the markdown specifications, which means I'll use headings with ### and provide a bullet list. It should be concise and not too verbose, so I'll focus on clarity. 

Also, I should check if I need to use `todo_write`, but since this is a read-only task, I can skip that. I'll create an answer that’s minimal and clear, including a bullet list mapping for each log line. While I could include a small code reference for confirmation, it’s not strictly necessary, so I’ll keep the message focused and straightforward.
**Composing server log explanation**

First, I’ll start with a brief status update: “I looked up the log origins in `src/app/api/submit/route.ts`.”

Next, I’ll provide an explanation mapping the logs:

- Drive parent in use: retrieving the configured Google Drive parent folder ID.
- Resolved parent folder: verifying metadata of that folder.
- Files detected for upload: recognizing keys in the multipart/form data.
- Drive folder ready: created a per-student subfolder with ID, URL, and name.
- Uploaded to Drive: confirmation of each file successfully uploaded.
- Submit payload keys: keys included in the final payload for submission.
- Notes/AdditionalComments: logs showing fields that are 'undefined None' if not provided.
- Resolved folder URL: included in the payload.
- POST /api/submit 200: indicates the request completed successfully.

I’ll note that all of these are console.log statements, but listing numerous line numbers isn't necessary. Also, if any personally identifiable info appears, we should suggest removing it before production. 

As a quick suggestion, I can mention: “If this is too noisy or sensitive, you can use a NODE_ENV check to gate these logs or remove them.” 

And while the code snippet might not be necessary, I could include something like:

```ts
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') console.log(...)
```

But I’ll aim for minimalism throughout the message.</details></think>

I looked up the origins of those messages in `src/app/api/submit/route.ts`.

### What this output is
- **Server logs from your `/api/submit` handler** during a successful submission. It’s tracing a Google Drive upload flow plus the final payload sent onward.

### Line-by-line meaning
- **Drive parent in use**: Using your configured Google Drive parent folder ID.
- **Resolved parent folder**: Confirmed metadata for that Drive folder.
- **Files detected for upload**: The file fields found in the request (e.g., `nationalID`, `transcript1`).
- **Drive folder ready**: A per-student subfolder was created; shows its ID/URL/name.
- **Uploaded to Drive**: Each file successfully uploaded; shows Drive file ID and name.
- **Submit payload keys**: Keys included in the final payload sent after upload.
- **Notes/AdditionalComments**: What was supplied for notes; `undefined None` means none provided.
- **Resolved folderUrl**: The Drive folder link included in the payload.
- **POST /api/submit 200**: The route completed successfully.

If you want to reduce noise or avoid logging PII in production, wrap these `console.log` calls with a check on `process.env.NODE_ENV` or remove them for prod.

On the AdditionalDetailsStep.tsx, can we make the computeNeeded result text Bold and Red?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Inspecting project styles**

I think I need to use read_file before applying the patch to check the content. It’s also important to always preserve indentation characters. I’m planning to wrap computed text in a span with Tailwind classes, possibly "font-bold text-red-600". But first, I need to confirm that the project uses Tailwind and check for class names in tailwind.config.js. It’s a good idea to inspect the file for style conventions before making changes. Let’s open the file and take a look!</details></think>

---

I'll open `src/components/steps/AdditionalDetailsStep.tsx` to locate where the `computeNeeded` result is rendered, then update its styles to be bold and red.

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/components/steps/AdditionalDetailsStep.tsx

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Applying style changes**

I see where adjustments are needed for the text rendered in lines 63-67, specifically in the "Prerequisite Program Transcript Needed:" section. They want it bold and red, so I plan to add the classes for it. I think using "text-red-600" is a good start, but maybe I should opt for a stronger shade. I'll switch to "font-bold text-red-600" to ensure it's both bold and red, while also keeping everything consistent. So, I'll go ahead and apply this patch to line 64.</details></think>

I’m going to update the rendered `needed` text in `src/components/steps/AdditionalDetailsStep.tsx` to use bold and red styling.

Made the `computeNeeded` result text bold and red.

- Edited `src/components/steps/AdditionalDetailsStep.tsx` to render the `needed` span with `font-bold text-red-600`.

You should now see the prerequisite transcript result in bold red when applicable.
