# Save documents into student folders (2025-10-15 00:10Z)

_**User (2025-10-15 00:10Z)**_

okay app needs to write/save each document into the students folder that is created and captured in the first column of the document.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering document saving feature**

I need to implement a feature where each document is saved into the student folder specified in the first column of a document—likely a CSV. The user seems to reference that first column for folder names. I’ll review the logic in api/submit/route.ts to check how the file upload works. It sounds like we might need to handle multiple files along with a spreadsheet that indicates where to save each document based on the folder names.
**Implementing multi-step form uploads**

There’s a multi-step form with document uploads in the app, and it likely stores information in memory or a serverless function. I need to enable writing to disk on the server since Next.js will handle form data in the /api/submit route. The Vercel file system is ephemeral, but locally I can save files to `public/uploads/<studentFolder>/filename.ext`. The wording about "the first column of the document" might refer to an Excel/CSV file included as AdditionalDocuments. I’ll need to open route.ts, create a to-do list for edits, and update the status as I go.
**Exploring code structure**

I should check both utils/submitApplication.tsx and components/DocumentUploadStep for naming conventions, but I’ll start with the route first. My plan is to run read_file on route.ts to see its contents. This way, I can understand how the routing is set up, which is crucial for implementing the uploads correctly. Once I have that information, I can dive deeper into the other files to ensure everything aligns as expected.</details></think>

I'll scan the API submit route to see how file uploads are handled and where we can add logic to save each uploaded document into a per-student folder derived from the first column value.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating document storage**

I need to address the user's requirement: they want each document saved into a student folder indicated in the first column of the sheet. The code appears to create a Drive folder and upload files directly into it, as noted in the comments. It captures the folder URL as a hyperlink in column 1, and the sheet handles file links appropriately. It looks like this requirement is already implemented, which is great news!
**Clarifying file storage**

It seems the user's request might suggest that the app isn't currently saving files into the intended created folder, or perhaps it was only saving them to a general folder before. The code indicates it's uploading to a specified folder ID. They likely want to use the hyperlink in the first column to determine where to save documents after row creation. However, since the code captures the student folder's link, it seems the requirements are being met. There may be some confusion about whether they mean a local directory versus Google Drive.
**Assessing document storage functionality**

The project doesn't include any local storage code, which means the "document" likely refers to the Google Sheet, with the "first column" being the folder link in Column A. The user wants to ensure national IDs and transcripts are stored in the designated Google Drive folder for the student, which is already set up. They may also want uploaded document names to specify the country for transcripts. I’ll clarify that the code saves to the Google Drive folder as intended and confirm the hyperlink in the first column shows this. If users encounter issues, the DRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER_ID variable or the supportsAllDrives setting could be factors to check.
**Following developer instructions**

I need to act as an agent and keep progressing until everything is resolved. Updates are essential, especially when we’re using tools, and the message should include a micro-update upfront. In past messages, the status update was placed before the tool call, which aligns with the guidelines. 

Now, I need to determine if any code changes are necessary. If everything's already implemented correctly, I can just clarify that uploads are happening as intended.
**Confirming document management functionality**

I reviewed the current API route, and it already saves files into the created Drive folder while recording the folder URL in the first sheet column. The requirement to "save each document into the students folder" is satisfied. 

- **Folder Creation:** Lines 139-152 show how the folder is created and the URL is set:
```javascript
139:152:c:\Projects\transcript-uploader\src\app\api\submit\route.ts
... code ...
```
- **File Uploading:** Lines 190-199 confirm files are uploaded with the parent folder ID:
```javascript
190:199:c:\Projects\transcript-uploader\src\app\api\submit\route.ts
... code ...
```
- **Hyperlink Building:** Lines 270-273 demonstrate building the hyperlink for column A:
```javascript
270:273:c:\Projects\transcript-uploader\src\app\api\submit\route.ts
... code ...
```
If you'd like documents organized into subfolders or have any issues, let me know!</details></think>

I reviewed the current submit API. It already creates a Drive folder, records its link in the first sheet column, and uploads every provided document into that folder.

```139:152:c:\Projects\transcript-uploader\src\app\api\submit\route.ts
      try {
        const res = await createFolder(true);
        const id = res.data.id;
        if (!id) throw new Error('Failed to create Drive folder');
        folderId = id;
        folderUrl = `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/${id}`;
      } catch (e) {
        // Fallback: create at root if parent is invalid or not shared
        const res = await createFolder(false);
        const id = res.data.id;
        if (!id) throw new Error('Failed to create Drive folder (fallback)');
        folderId = id;
        folderUrl = `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/${id}`;
      }
```

```190:199:c:\Projects\transcript-uploader\src\app\api\submit\route.ts
          const driveName = `${namePrefix}${typeLabel}${ext}`;
          const res = await drive.files.create({
            requestBody: {
              name: driveName,
              parents: [folderId],
            },
            media: {
              mimeType: (f as any).type || 'application/octet-stream',
              body: Buffer.isBuffer(buffer) ? buffer : Buffer.from(buffer),
            } as any,
```

```270:273:c:\Projects\transcript-uploader\src\app\api\submit\route.ts
    const row = orderedKeys.map(k => {
      // Column 1: hyperlink labeled as folder name (last_first-degree-student)
      if (k === '__FOLDER_URL__') return folderUrl ? buildHyperlink(folderUrl, folderName || 'Open Folder') : (folderName || '');
```

- The first column stores the folder link via a HYPERLINK formula.
- Each file upload uses `parents: [folderId]`, placing it inside that student’s folder.

If you’re seeing files land outside the student folder, likely causes:
- Missing or wrong `DRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER_ID` or service account lacks access to the destination Drive.
- Upload fields are empty; only non-empty files are uploaded.

Want me to also organize files into subfolders inside each student folder (e.g., ID, Transcripts, Additional Docs)?

_**User (2025-10-15 00:10Z)**_

no subfolders are needed just end with extention like _ID, _trancript1 etc

_**Assistant (gpt-5)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying file name requirements**

We need to make changes regarding file naming. The instruction is that there shouldn't be subfolders, and file names should end with identifiers like _ID or _transcript1. The term "extension" seems vague, indicating they refer to a suffix rather than the file extension. In the current code, we generate names such as `Doe_John_transcript1.pdf`, which fulfills the requirement. I'm wondering if they want an additional underscore before the type label, though it seems unnecessary given how we're structuring the names.
**Understanding file naming conventions**

I see that the current file names look like "Doe_John_transcript1.pdf." The request is to end file names with labels like _ID or _transcript1, suggesting they want a suffix added to the base name. In our code, we create a namePrefix from the student's folder. There seems to be some confusion about case sensitivity and proper spelling. While I think the label should indeed be part of the name before the file extension, I’m uncertain if they prefer specific suffix formatting or if I misinterpreted “extension” in the request.
**Clarifying file naming requirements**

I’m considering if they want to append suffixes like _ID or _transcript1 directly to the folder name. It seems they might mean that the filenames should end with these suffixes after the student's folder name, such as "StudentFolderName_ID.pdf," rather than just using the current namePrefix. They've mentioned wanting each document saved in the student's folder with these specific endings, and it sounds like they may actually want to use the full folder name as the prefix instead of just the first and last names.
**Modifying file naming structure**

Given the instruction to "end with extension like _ID, _transcript1," I think it’s best to adjust the code to `driveName = \`${folderName}_${typeLabel}${ext}\``. This will ensure the filenames have the correct suffixes. I’ll also need to update typeLabel to uppercase for consistency. It seems they wrote _transcript1 incorrectly, but I'll just ignore that.

The goal is to derive names from folderName instead of namePrefix, and I'll ensure the formatting is correct with underscores. I’ll also sanitize folderName since it’s created by buildStudentFolderName, which is safe to reuse.
**Updating file name creation**

I’m planning to change how driveName is created. It will be formatted as `${folderName}_${typeLabel}${ext}`, while ensuring that folderName can include hyphens. This should yield names like 'Last_First-Degree-StudentType_ID.pdf'. I’ll maintain permission creation and keep the comment about no subfolders since it's already in place.

I’ll also adjust typeLabel to be uppercase where needed, ensuring consistent labeling. The plan is to remove namePrefix altogether to avoid unnecessary variable usage and prevent linter errors. After all changes, I’ll run read_lints to check for any issues.</details></think>

---

I'll update the file-naming logic so uploaded files inside each student's folder are named using the student folder name with a suffix like `_ID`, `_transcript1`, etc., and then check for linter issues.

- Changed Drive upload names to use the student folder name as the base with suffixes, e.g. `Last_First-Degree-Type_ID.pdf`, `..._transcript1.pdf`, `..._additionaldoc1.png`. This happens where each file is created with `drive.files.create`, using `name: `${folderName}_${typeLabel}${ext}``.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing file-saving issues**

I need to figure out why files aren't being saved. It looks like the backend is set up to handle FormData entries properly, but I should check for mismatches between the keys in the frontend and backend. The backend normalizes keys by removing spaces, capitalizing letters, and adjusting certain names. The frontend uses lowerCamelCase, which should match the backend. However, I notice they might be appending 'FolderUrl' in a way that could cause issues with how it's normalized later.
**Exploring potential upload issues**

The backend doesn't use the same key structure as the frontend, but that's not the main problem. I need to look at the fetch body when transitioning to the next route with FormData in Next.js. There's a potential body size limit on Vercel serverless, which might be around 4.5MB. If the user is local, the issue could be due to missing Google API credentials. They mentioned that "files are still not being saved," so there could be a problem in the upload code, specifically with how File objects are handled.
**Identifying potential upload bugs**

I noticed that there's some redundancy in the code with `Buffer.isBuffer(buffer)`, but it seems fine overall. A potential bug is that while `typeLabelByKey` uses 'nationalID', the `normalizeKey` might still produce the same from 'NationalID'. The frontend uses exact property names in lowerCamelCase for keys, which is good. For instance, 'transcript1', 'transcript2', and 'additionalDoc1', 'additionalDoc2' are set correctly. However, they also append 'FolderUrl' without ensuring the files are appended under their specific desired keys, even though 'nationalCountry' is handled properly in the backend.
**Investigating upload issues**

I see there's a potentially unused script, 'src/utils/submitApplication.tsx', that posts to a Firebase Cloud Function. The MultiStepForm is instead using fetch to "/api/submit," which is good. Could the issue with files not being saved relate to a lack of access in Google Drive, specifically with the constants used for folder IDs? The service account must have access to the specified folder. If the parent ID is invalid, it defaults to root, but they may not be appending File objects to the FormData correctly on the client side, which could be the real issue.
**Identifying upload challenges**

The MultiStepForm uses `Object.entries(submissionData)`, and while 'submissionData' has File objects, null or undefined properties could lead to issues. They’re not appending certain fields like 'transcript3' and 'transcript4', which are null. There’s also a potential problem with the runtime settings: specifying 'nodejs' instead of 'edge'. The files not being saved could stem from a lack of proper Google Drive API credentials leading to silent errors from `drive.files.create`. Thus, I need to implement robust error logging. Moreover, I must ensure the file upload logic aligns with the required expectations, especially regarding formats and limits.
**Refining upload error handling**

To ensure robust functionality, I need to verify whether the `value` is actually a File object by checking its properties. In the Node 'nodejs' runtime, the global `File` exists, so `value instanceof File` should hold true. We also have to log errors effectively to catch silent failures during file uploads. I will implement flags for tracking upload errors, making sure to provide clear error messages if uploads fail. Plus, let's confirm that FormData keys from the frontend match those expected by the backend and make any necessary adjustments to naming conventions to ensure consistency.</details></think>

---

I’m going to add robust error logging and fail fast if Drive uploads fail, plus log the upload keys so we can pinpoint why nothing is saved. Then I’ll run the linter on the updated file.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing file saving issues**

I need to figure out why files aren't being saved properly. We've set up logging, so that should help. I'll analyze the mismatch between the frontend field names and the backend's normalization process. The backend's `normalizeKey` method modifies keys in specific ways. On the frontend, the `MultiStepForm` uses keys that should match the backend after normalization. However, I'll need to look closely at how `FormData` is constructed and whether it includes the correct File objects. There’s a check in the code to append Files if they meet size requirements.
**Ensuring proper UI submission**

I need to make sure that the UI step properly uses `FormNavigation` to submit through `handleSubmit` at the Review step. The `MultiStepForm` fetches data from "/api/submit." If nothing is saving, it could be due to missing service account credentials, which would lead to a 500 error. The user said it's "still not being saved," so maybe the sheet row is appending, but files are not. Also, I need to check if the Next.js API route is using Edge instead of Node runtime, as this could affect functionality. Additionally, I'm looking at how the Google Drive API interacts with the File object. Proper key names like 'FolderUrl' are also crucial.
**Understanding normalization and mismatches**

The backend normalizes 'FolderUrl' to 'folderUrl' through the `normalizeKey` method, but it's actually provided as a base file name and not a URL. This isn’t a blocker, but I’m wondering if there are issues with the `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable, particularly in handling newlines. If not set, it would throw an error. Additionally, the dev environment might have an invalid parent folder ID, but there's a fallback to root.

On the frontend, the country field names use 'nationalCountryCode' and 't1CountryCode', which differ from the backend's naming conventions. Furthermore, there’s a mismatch with the additional naming where ‘additionalDocs1’ is normalized to ‘additionalDoc1’. It’s important to look at how these keys are being managed to ensure everything aligns correctly.
**Examining frontend naming and file saving issues**

On the frontend, I see the field names include 'additionalDoc1'. But I’m wondering about the difference between `nationalID` and 'NationalID'. The UI uses 'nationalID', while an earlier version of `src/utils/types.ts` uses 'NationalID'. However, that earlier module isn’t relevant here. It’s good to note that the `MultiStepForm` also creates computed filenames like `nationalIDFilename`, which the backend ignores, and that’s okay.

Now, concerning file saving, I'm considering whether the body size limit in Next.js Route handlers could be causing issues. The limit might be set to 2MB by default when using `Request.formData()`, so it’s worth looking into!
**Investigating file handling and permissions**

In Next.js 14/15, while route handlers should handle large payloads, there's no straightforward body parser limit like in API routes, and the default request body size might be 1MB. The Google Drive API expects the media body to be provided as a stream or buffer, and we've ensured we've added the necessary 'drive' scope.

I need to examine if the FormData correctly includes File objects and if the names of keys on the frontend match what the backend expects. Also, if the student’s folder is created in the service account's drive, the users may not see it in their personal Google Drives. They should verify the DRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER_ID to ensure it's set to a location where the service account has access.
**Identifying issues and proposing solutions**

It seems like files may not be visible to the user because they were created under the service account's private root. We should verify environment variables and consider stronger error handling if folder creation fails. 

Primary issues could include a wrong Parent folder ID or permissions on the service account. We should check if the service account has access to the parent folder and ensure the environment variables are set correctly.

Additionally, we’ll log keys and sizes from the backend and emphasize making the upload process fail if any file upload fails. 

Lastly, we’ll include updated code references to where errors are logged or swallowed.
**Summarizing action steps**

It looks like files might not be appearing because uploads are likely failing silently due to missing permissions for the service account on the parent folder, resulting in files being created in the service account's drive root. 

We should provide steps to fix this: share the target Drive folder ID with the service account, set the `DRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER_ID` in the environment variables, and ensure the correct service account is used.

If issues persist, we might suggest modifying the code to throw errors on upload failures for faster diagnosis. We should also request their runtime logs after asking them to retry.

Finally, I will include code references for silent catches and folder creation fallback for clarity.</details></think>

I instrumented the API with upload diagnostics. The core issue is very likely that Drive uploads are failing silently due to missing service‑account access to the parent folder; uploads are swallowed and the handler still returns “Saved”.

- Evidence 1 – upload errors were previously swallowed:
```215:219:c:\Projects\transcript-uploader\src\app\api\submit\route.ts
        } catch (e) {
          // Log upload error for visibility
          try { console.error('Drive upload failed for key:', k, e); } catch {}
          // skip on upload error; we'll fall back to file name in sheet
        }
```

- Evidence 2 – if the parent folder is invalid/inaccessible, it falls back to creating the student folder at the service account’s private root (you won’t see it in your personal Drive unless you open the link):
```145:152:c:\Projects\transcript-uploader\src\app\api\submit\route.ts
      } catch (e) {
        // Fallback: create at root if parent is invalid or not shared
        const res = await createFolder(false);
        const id = res.data.id;
        if (!id) throw new Error('Failed to create Drive folder (fallback)');
        folderId = id;
        folderUrl = `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/${id}`;
      }
```

What to do now
- Ensure the service account has Editor on the intended parent folder or use a Shared Drive.
  - Share the target Drive folder with `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`.
  - Set `DRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER_ID` to that folder’s ID (env var in your deployment).
- Retry a submission and check server logs for the new messages:
  - “Drive folder ready …”
  - “Uploaded to Drive …” per file
  - Any “Drive upload failed …” errors will pinpoint the cause (permission, file size, etc.).
- Open the folder link stored in column 1 of the sheet to confirm files appear there. If you can open the link but don’t see it in your personal Drive, that confirms it’s under the service account’s Drive.

If you want, I can change the API to fail the request when any file upload fails (instead of succeeding) to make issues visible immediately.

- I added upload logging and kept your “no subfolders” naming by saving as `folderName_<suffix>.<ext>`.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating user issue**

I need to respond concisely while also resolving the issue the user mentioned about it working previously. I should investigate what might have changed: 

It could be differences in environment variables, access issues with service accounts, or changes in key formatting. 

I also wonder if there's a body size limitation, especially since Next.js accepts formData() for streaming but large files might hit Vercel's limits. I'll check if the frontend keys are correctly normalized too, ensuring all match expected formats.
**Reviewing potential issues**

I see that we've changed some field names like 'FolderUrl' to 'folderUrl', but that shouldn't affect uploading logic. I need to check MultiStepForm code to confirm all values are being appended properly, including the 'FolderUrl' string placeholder. 

There's a potential bug in DocumentUploadStep, where the input has an empty string set when form.nationalID exists. Using a value prop on file inputs isn't allowed, which could prevent selection.

I also need to consider the permissions set on shared drives and double-check that the DRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER_ID environment variable isn't causing issues by defaulting to a constant if it's not set.
**Analyzing service account issues**

I suspect the constant might not be accessible by the service account in production because it was working when they had the environment variable set, but that was later removed. Now it uses a default reference that could affect folder creation access. 

They mentioned it was working previously, but issues like service account key rotation or missing scopes may be responsible. 

We’ve added logs, which is great. I propose some new checks, like failing if the uploadKeys length is greater than zero but none were uploaded and ensuring 'transcript1' is mapped correctly. I'll also check server logs and the environment settings.
**Enhancing error handling**

I think we should implement stricter error handling for upload failures. The developer might not want to degrade the process, but they did ask for a code review. 

I need to check the top part of route.ts to confirm that the constants and the default parent folder ID are present—like line 12, which specifies a specific folder ID. If that folder isn't accessible anymore, the fallback to createFolder(true) could fail because it might not be in the service account's drive or the drive type could be incorrect. 

If the DRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER_ID environment variable was previously set to a shared drive folder and is now missing, that might explain why uploads still occur, but users don't see their files because of the new location.
**Reviewing upload process and error handling**

I see that they check the 'folder link' in the sheet, which should redirect to the created folder. If users are saying nothing is saved, that might indicate upload issues. The code only uploads if folderId is set, and it's confirmed to be set, but upload errors may be swallowed. 

If there's a large file, it could exceed Vercel's limits since Next.js route handlers default to a 1MB size for JSON. Also, MultiStepForm needs to ensure the 'folder' property is included correctly, and it computes folder names using specific details. 

It seems crucial to implement additional error handling, especially tracking upload attempts and successes. If no files upload, we should throw an error with guidance on checking permissions. I’ll add logging for empty files and ensure we gather counts for attempted and successful uploads before proceeding with the code changes.</details></think>

I’m going to add stricter checks: count attempted and successful uploads, throw an error if none succeed, and log when no files were provided. Then I’ll lint the file.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing the issue**

The user mentioned that it was working at one point, so now I need to diagnose what changed. We made some updates to route.ts, including renaming and adding logging. Possible reasons for the current issue might be service account permissions or changes in the parent folder environment variable. I’m considering the Edge runtime versus Node. I see they have set the expected runtime correctly in their file. However, if there's a new default body size limit in Next.js 14, that could play a role.
**Analyzing submission data**

I see that submissionData uses Object.entries to pull in the File objects from state under keys like nationalID, transcript1, and transcript2. These are appended to FormData, and it looks like the server normalizes those keys correctly. However, there might be a bug with initialFormData including transcript3 and transcript4, which aren't in the server's label map — but this shouldn’t cause failure. Another thing to check is the fetch call to "/api/submit"; they don’t set Content-Type, which is fine. Maybe environment variables have changed during deployment.
**Investigating upload issues**

I’m considering that the private key may have literal "\n" characters, but it seems they replace those correctly. I noticed that if jwt.authorize fails, it would throw an error and return 500. However, the user mentioned that files aren’t being saved. The sheet append might still occur if uploads fail silently, but we added a throw for no uploads. Another possibility is if they switched to a Shared Drive without adding 'supportsAllDrives: true' on all operations. I see they have included that for creating folders, but the service account still needs access to upload.
**Identifying upload issues**

The bug involves the MultiStepForm creating a 'baseFileName' and then setting submissionData.folder to that, but the server ignores 'folder' and uses its own method to build the folder name. I’m wondering why files aren't saved. It might be due to the Node runtime's file size limit in Next. Even though they set Node explicitly, Next 14 defaults to Edge. Another possible issue is that app routes may need to disable bodyParser, but using Request.formData in the app router is fine. The UI state for file input seems odd too; it might affect the saving process. Drive permissions still feel like the main suspect.
**Reviewing the issue**

I understand that the user mentioned it was working before, so I’m considering potential reasons for the regression. It could be a change in the parent folder ID, a service account switched, or even moving to a different Google Cloud project. I’ll suggest checking the environment variables and service account access.

I’ll provide a checklist for them, emphasizing the need to verify that the sharing settings are correct and to monitor logs for errors. If files appear linked in the sheet, that's a good sign they may still be accessible. I’ll also suggest checking if they're deploying on Vercel.</details></think>

---

It likely regressed due to environment/permissions, not code. The API was swallowing Drive upload failures, so Sheets still updated while files weren’t saved. I added strict logging and a hard failure if no file uploads succeed.

- Verify these envs in your deploy (Vercel/host) match your working setup:
  - GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
  - GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY or GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64
  - DRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER_ID (must be the intended parent folder)
  - SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID (unchanged)
- Ensure the parent Drive folder is shared with the service account as Editor (Shared Drive recommended). If `DRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER_ID` is wrong or not shared, the code falls back to creating the student folder at the service account’s root, which you won’t see in your personal Drive.

What you should check now
- Submit again and watch server logs:
  - You should see “Drive folder ready …”, one “Uploaded to Drive …” per file, or explicit “Drive upload failed …”.
- Open the folder link stored in column 1 of the sheet; if it opens and shows files, they’re being created under the service account’s Drive.

Key spots
```139:152:src/app/api/submit/route.ts
      } catch (e) {
        // Fallback: create at root if parent is invalid or not shared
        const res = await createFolder(false);
        ...
        folderUrl = `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/${id}`;
      }
```
```172:219:src/app/api/submit/route.ts
    const uploadKeys = Object.keys(filesByKey);
    ...
    if (folderId) {
      try { console.log('Drive folder ready:', { folderId, folderUrl, folderName }); } catch {}
      let successfulUploadCount = 0;
      for (const k of uploadKeys) {
        ...
        if (id) {
          ...
          try { console.log('Uploaded to Drive:', { key: k, name: driveName, id }); } catch {}
          successfulUploadCount += 1;
        }
      }
      if (uploadKeys.length > 0 && successfulUploadCount === 0) {
        throw new Error('No files were uploaded to Drive. Please verify DRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER_ID and service account access.');
      }
    } else {
      try { console.error('No Drive folderId resolved; cannot upload files.'); } catch {}
    }
```

If you want, I can make the API refuse to append to Sheets unless at least one file upload succeeds (strict mode), so failures are immediately visible to users instead of silently “Saved.”
